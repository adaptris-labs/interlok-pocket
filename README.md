# interlok-pocket
Mobile app show-casing interaction with the UI REST Interface.

The Interlok Pocket project is a proof of concept (POC) application.
It is a demonstration of a mobile app interacting with the Interlok UI REST Interface.

Essentially, the POC has 2 pages. One page takes the settings for which Interlok UI you are using, and another page that queries that UIs API and displays the names and states of the Adapters that are registered to it.

As you can see there's been no activity on this for a while; we never got past the POC stage but we might revisit it one day when there is demand for it.

To get started with this project, you need to have a development environment setup for flutter:
